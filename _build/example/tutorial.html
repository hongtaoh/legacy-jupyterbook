<p>Jupyterbook totally changed the way a book is built in April 2020. The final legacy version is <a href="https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyter-book/releases/tag/v0.6.5">v0.6.5</a>. You can compare the <a href="https://legacy.jupyterbook.org/intro.html">legacy demo</a> with the <a href="https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html">newest version demo</a>.</p>
<p>You can install the legacy version <a href="https://pypi.org/project/jupyter-book/0.6.5/">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Using-Jupyterbook">Using Jupyterbook<a class="anchor-link" href="#Using-Jupyterbook"> </a></h2><p>In this article, I'll briefly talk about how to use this legacy version of jupyterbook together with GitHub and Netlify.</p>
<p>First off, you should install the legacy version using <code>pip install jupyter-book==0.6.5</code> as mentioned above. Then, I will show you how to start a book named "legacy-jupyterbook" on Desktop. I am asusming that you are using a Mac. All the following codes should run in Terminal.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">cd</span> Desktop <span class="c1"># or any other directory you want to place your project</span>
jupyter-book create legacy-jupyterbook <span class="c1"># You&#39;ll see the file created on Desktop</span>
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;2.6.2&quot;</span> &gt; .ruby-version <span class="c1"># To put a .ruby-version file in there</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The <code>echo "2.6.2" &gt; .ruby-version</code> solution come from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/38194231">here</a>.</p>
<p>Then, go to GitHub, and create a repository <strong>without</strong> checking "Initialize this repository with a README". Take a look at this HTTPS address:</p>
<p><img src="https://hongtaoh.com/media/enblog/legacy-jupyterbook-github-repo-https.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Then, go back to your Terminal:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">cd</span> legacy-jupyterbook
git init
<span class="nb">cd</span> .. <span class="c1"># To go back to the Desktop directory because the following line only functions in a level higher than the current one</span>
jupyter-book build legacy-jupyterbook
<span class="nb">cd</span> - <span class="c1"># To go back to legacy-jupyterbook</span>
git add .
git commit -m “uploading initial files.”
git remote add origin https://github.com/hhao1992/second-try.git <span class="c1"># Replace it with yours</span>
git push -u origin master
</pre></div>
<p>Then, you'll see some security alerts:</p>
<p><img src="https://hongtaoh.com/media/enblog/legacy-jupyterbook-alert01.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://hongtaoh.com/media/enblog/legacy-jupyterbook-alert02.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Solve them this way:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>rm -rf Gemfile.lock
make install 
git add .
git commit -m <span class="s2">&quot;changing Gemfile.lock.&quot;</span>
git push origin master
</pre></div>
<p>The above solution come from <a href="https://www.bookstack.cn/read/jupyterbook/8124f882effb2130.md#What%20is%20this%20Gemfile.lock%20file%20or%20why%20am%20I%20getting%20Jekyll%20dependency%20warnings?">here</a>.</p>
<p>Then go to <a href="www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> and connect to the GitHub repo. When we deploy the Jupyterbook project with Nellify, it will automatically know that this is a Jekyll theme and you don't need to change anything. I am not detailing what you can do with Netlify here. Please look for information about it by yourself if you are not familiar with it already.</p>
<p>If you want to make changes later, first please <code>cd path/to/YourProject</code> and then use the following script:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>rm -rf _build <span class="c1">#If you are familiar with Jekyll, you&#39;ll know what _build mean here.</span>
<span class="nb">cd</span> ..
jupyter-book build YourProject
<span class="nb">cd</span> YourProject
git add .
<span class="nv">msg</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;rebuilding site </span><span class="k">$(</span>date<span class="k">)</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span> 
git commit -m <span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="nv">$msg</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span> 
git push origin master
</pre></div>
<p>You can store this file as <code>deploy.sh</code>, save it to the root directory of YourProject. Every time after you've make all the changes you want, at the root directory of YourProject, simply run <code>bash deploy.sh</code> and Github and Netlify will deploy by themseles.</p>
<h2 id="Example">Example<a class="anchor-link" href="#Example"> </a></h2><p>Finally, you can view the final product of the example I provided above <a href="https://legacy-jupyterbook.netlify.app/">here</a>. And <a href="https://github.com/hongtaoh/legacy-jupyterbook">here</a> is its GitHub repository.</p>
<h2 id="Changing-content">Changing content<a class="anchor-link" href="#Changing-content"> </a></h2><p>I am not detailing how to customize the content here. You simply need to change it in the <code>content</code> folder at the root directory, and then make corressponding changes to <code>toc.yml</code> under the <code>_data</code> folder. You can find more information in the <a href="https://legacy.jupyterbook.org/intro.html">official guide</a></p>
