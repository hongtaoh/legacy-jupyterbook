# What You Can Do with Markdown

You are encouraged to read carefully this [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to get a deeper understanding of how to write in Markdown. 

Most of the codes in that Cheatsheet will work with Markdown in Hugo:

## Headings

You can have six levels of section headings:


### H3
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6

## Blockquotes


> What I cannot create, I do not understand. **Note** that you can use *Markdown syntax* within a blockquote.


## Lists

You can create a list, both numbered or not:

### Ordered List

1. Buy a fridge
2. Go to Kroger
3. Pay for items

### Unordered List

- Buy a fridge
- Go to Kroger
- Pay for items

### Nested list

- Buy a fridge
  1. Go to Kroger
  2. Pay for items

## Shortcodes

You should also know that Hugo has many shortcodes that make writing in Markdown more powerful.

For example, you can use the following codes to add figures:
